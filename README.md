Cerebra E-commerce Data Analysis

The Cerebra Project is an end-to-end data analysis initiative aimed at understanding e-commerce sales patterns, customer behavior, and market opportunities through structured analysis and visualization. Using a dataset of over 10,000 product sales records, the project replicates real-world retail analytics challenges, focusing on deriving actionable insights to support marketing optimization, inventory management, and customer engagement.

Problem Statement

E-commerce companies often collect vast amounts of raw data, but without proper analysis, these records do not contribute to decision-making. The key challenge was to transform this raw data into meaningful insights that could directly improve business strategies.

Approach

The project employed Excel, SQL, and Power BI for data handling and reporting. Data cleaning was done in Excel to remove duplicates, standardize formats, and handle missing values. SQL queries were used to perform aggregations, validations, and trend analysis across transactions. Power BI was then used to build interactive dashboards highlighting sales performance, demographics, and demand patterns.

The dashboards focused on:

Sales by product category and region

Customer demographics and purchasing patterns

Device preferences (mobile, desktop, tablet)

Average transactions per user/city

Seasonal and time-based demand trends

Key Insights & Impact

40% of total sales came from top-performing product categories.

Metro cities generated the highest transactions, guiding targeted campaigns.

Younger customers (18â€“30) were the most active buyers.

Mobile platforms contributed 65% of total sales, stressing mobile-first strategies.

Reporting efficiency improved by 40%, enabling faster business decision-making.

This project demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, SQL querying, and dashboard development with Power BI, showcasing how raw e-commerce data can be converted into strategic insights for real-world business problems.
